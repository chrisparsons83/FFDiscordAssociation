6.2. Draft order will be determined by the members of each division so long as the order is agreed by majority vote to be sufficiently random.

6.2b.: The draft order may be either completely random or pick position may be chosen by individual members provided the order in which the members are able to pick is randomly generated.

6.7. If a member does not attend the draft and does not provide notice otherwise, the members who are in attendance must wait a minimum of 15 minutes from the original draft time and then a vote may be called to decide if the team should be autodrafted or if a neutral 3rd party within the discord should draft in the absent member’s place.

## 7. Waivers

7.5. If there is a tie between multiple teams on the amount bid for a player, the tiebreaker is determined by the inverse order of standings.

7.6. It is expected that all players in the NFL universe may be rostered. This rule may be dependent on the hosting site in question. FFDiscord commissioners do not have control over adding players into the system that are missing.

## 8. Trading

8.1. Trades will open up immediately upon the conclusion of the draft, and will remain open until the trade deadline, which is in week 10 of the NFL season.

8.2. Trades will not have a review period (effective immediately when accepted) and will be conducted under the integrity system.

9.1. The regular season will last through Week 13 of the NFL regular season.

9.2. The head-to-head matchup schedule will be auto-generated by Sleeper.

9.3 Each team is expected to field a valid lineup (no bye week players, no players on IR from any week prior). See rule 9.5 for situations where an empty slot is allowed.

9.4 In the event of a computer failure, the league member must contact the commissioner via email or phone to request a roster substitution.  The substitution must be made prior to each player locking.  In the event of a request made before a lock, but the commissioner cannot address it before it locks, the commissioner will inform the member’s opponent of the situation, and retroactively set the roster.

9.5. The only time an empty roster spot is permitted is when a member is already beating an opponent who has no players remaining for the week.

9.6. Lineups lock individually at scheduled game time.

9.7. Weekly head-to-head matchups will be determined by starters points scored.

## 13. Promotion/Relegation

13.1. At the end of each season, a certain number of top and bottom players in each division will be promoted/relegated to the next higher/lower division. These promotion and relegation zones are set at the beginning of the season, with sizes determined by roster size of the given and proximal divisions and league pyramid structure.

13.2 In the case of any vacancy in the Premier Division, the first open spot will be given to one of the players that finished 3rd in their Division One league at the end of the season and meets all other requirements for membership. That player is drawn at random from the pool of players that are eligible. Subsequent spots will be drawn at random until that pool of players is exhausted. If further spots are needed, the process will be repeated with players that finished 4th in their Division One league at the end of the season. This will continue until there is a full roster of 12 for the Premier Division.

13.3.  Under no circumstance will a player who finishes in the relegation zone of a division return to that division the following season (except during seasons which involve significant player realignment).

13.4.  The promotion and relegation criteria for a given season will be determined and published before the start of the season.

## 14. Rookies

14.1. Rookies will begin in Division One.

## 15. Re-Entry

## 16. League Growth and Expansion

9.1. In future seasons, as the number of players increases, leagues will be added in Division One to accommodate the growth.

## 17. Player Conduct

10.1. Don't be a jerk, and be respectful to others. Abuse, disrespect, and assholishness are not tolerated.

10.2. Failure to comply with rule 10.1 is grounds for removal from the league. Warnings can optionally be provided by commissioners, but are not required to be removed from the league.
