## 5. League Hierarchy

5.1.  The FFDiscord Leagues are distributed into two "divisions": the Premier Division, and Division One. The Premier Division consists of a single 12-person league. Division One consists of multiple 12-person leagues, and can vary in quantity of leagues from season to season.

5.2.  At the beginning of each season, all eligible players that are not within the Premier Division will be played into one of the leagues within Division One. Placement in those leagues is done by random draw.

5.3.  Players only play against opponents within his or her league.

5.4.  There is only one champion per league (i.e. no ties or co-champions).

## 6. Promotion/Relegation

6.1. At the end of each season, a certain number of top and bottom players in each division will be promoted/relegated to the next higher/lower division. These promotion and relegation zones are set at the beginning of the season, with sizes determined by roster size of the given and proximal divisions and league pyramid structure.

6.2 In the case of any vacancy in the Premier Division, the first open spot will be given to one of the players that finished 3rd in their Division One league at the end of the season and meets all other requirements for membership. That player is drawn at random from the pool of players that are eligible. Subsequent spots will be drawn at random until that pool of players is exhausted. If further spots are needed, the process will be repeated with players that finished 4th in their Division One league at the end of the season. This will continue until there is a full roster of 12 for the Premier Division.

6.3.  Under no circumstance will a player who finishes in the relegation zone of a division return to that division the following season (except during seasons which involve significant player realignment).

6.4.  The promotion and relegation criteria for a given season will be determined and published before the start of the season.

## 7. Rookies

7.1. Rookies will begin in Division One.

## 8. Re-Entry

8.1 If a player leaves the league for a season, when applying for re-entry, their past seasons will not count towards priority placement.

8.2 Players removed from the FFDiscord Leagues for disciplinary reasons must be approved by a majority of the commissioners in order to be readmitted to the league.

## 9. League Growth and Expansion

9.1. In future seasons, as the number of players increases, leagues will be added in Division One to accommodate the growth.

## 10. Player Conduct

10.1. Don't be a jerk, and be respectful to others. Abuse, disrespect, and assholishness are not tolerated.

10.2. Failure to comply with rule 10.1 is grounds for removal from the league. Warnings can optionally be provided by commissioners, but are not required to be removed from the league.
